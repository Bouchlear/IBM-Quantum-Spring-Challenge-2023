# IBM-Quantum-Spring-Challenge-2023
This year’s challenge focus on dynamic circuits, a technology that makes it easier to run more-advanced quantum algorithms. Dynamic circuits allow you to include classical processing during the runtime of the circuit.
This spring’s challenge consists of five labs, each containing tutorial content and practice exercises to test your learning. By the end of the challenge, you’ll know how to implement dynamic circuits, and how we’re using them to help with error mitigation and quantum teleportation. The IBM Quantum Challenge is exactly that: a challenge.
